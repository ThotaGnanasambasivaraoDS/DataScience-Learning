Day-01:– Understanding Data Science & Defining the Learning Roadmap

Objective of Day 1:
The objective of Day 1 was to gain a clear, high-level understanding of Data Science as a field and to define a structured learning roadmap before starting hands-on implementation. The focus was on clarity, direction, and long-term planning rather than immediately learning tools.

What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines programming, mathematics, statistics, and domain knowledge to analyze data and extract meaningful insights that support decision-making and organizational growth.

Rather than being tool-centric, Data Science focuses on:
• Understanding real-world and business problems
• Translating problems into data-driven questions
• Designing optimized analytical or predictive solutions
• Communicating insights effectively to stakeholders
