Day 2 – Python Fundamentals (Data Science Foundation)

Overview  
This folder documents Day 2 of my Data Science learning journey, focused on building a strong foundation in Python fundamentals. These concepts are essential for writing clean, reliable code and for understanding how data is handled in real-world analytics and machine learning workflows.

The objective of this day was not just to learn syntax, but to clearly understand how Python works internally and how each concept supports future Data Science tasks.

Visual Overview  
Below is a mind map that visually represents the Python fundamentals covered on Day 2 and how they are connected as part of a Data Science foundation.
